# Ashintosh — Clean Homepage

This repository contains a simple personal homepage for Ashutosh V. Kumar.

What I changed:
- Simplified the homepage to a cleaner, Apple-like aesthetic.
- Added minimal CSS overrides in `assets/css/style.css` to create a centered hero and refined header.
- Fixed meta tags, social links, and accessibility attributes.

Next steps to publish to GitHub Pages:

1. Create a repository on GitHub and copy the remote URL.
2. Run these commands in the project root:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Clean: simplified homepage and styles"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

3. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings (branch `main`, folder `/ (root)`).

If you'd like, I can prepare the exact `git` commands for your repo URL and finish the todo list.
